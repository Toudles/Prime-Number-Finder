Write a program that prompts the user to enter in a postiive number. Only accept positive numbers - if the user supplies a negative number or zero you should re-prompt them.

Next, determine if the given number is a prime number. A prime number is a number that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. For example, 5 is prime because the only numbers that evenly divide into 5 are 1 and 5. 6, however, is not prime because 1, 2, 3 and 6 are all divisors of 6.
